# Work on web-design-system

Read [the complete project context](docs/PROJECT_ENTRYPOINT.md) before implementation work, together with every required guide linked there. It preserves the project-specific scope, ownership, source map, deployment and verification requirements. Apply the shared policy snapshot below; project guidance adds facts and does not replace the common acceptance contract.

<!-- VINASIG STANDARDS BEGIN -->
## VINASIG SI agent standards 0.1.0

Read `.vinasig/standards/policies/core.md` and `language.md` before repository work. Respect platform instructions, current user authorization and local project guidance. Preserve unrelated changes. Never invent verification or weaken a quality gate to pass.

Active profile is `web-typescript`. Read `.vinasig/standards/profiles/web-typescript.md` and the task-relevant policies. Core is valid for CLI and documentation projects and installs no browser dependencies.

Use `$vinasig-workflow` for implementation work and `$vinasig-dependencies` when adding or upgrading dependencies. Report PASS, FAIL, NOT_RUN or NOT_APPLICABLE with evidence and reasons. Commit, push and publish only within the task authorization.

For VINASIG project creation, publication or changed public facts, apply CORE-009 and `templates/project-publication.md`. Set Repo details for every new GitHub repository immediately with a description, verified website or README homepage, and relevant topics. Read saved GitHub values back. Synchronize affected website inventory and both org profile languages within current authorization. The public org profile is `VINASIG/.github/profile/README.md`. Report pending destinations.

For license selection, imported material or distribution changes read `policies/licensing.md` and `LICENSES.md` inside the snapshot. LIC-001 through LIC-004 require purpose-based selection, authority and dependency review, separate documentation/font/data/brand rights, consistent SPDX metadata and delivery evidence. Importing this standard does not relicense the host project.

For visible changes and new interfaces, apply WEB-010 and read templates/web/ui-contract.md first. Reproduce the exact symptom and inventory every mode, boundary, error, short/long output and timer state. Map each reported defect to a regression and opened before/after image. Use inspectUiContract where applicable. Check real Pause/Resume with the pointer on the control, local field errors, card/icon gaps, fitted output, adjacent actions and visible depleted progress. Passing initial-mode tests or merely saving screenshots does not approve the UI. Repeat affected live states before claiming completion.

For ecosystem preferences apply WEB-011 and read templates/web/shared-preferences.md. Default to system appearance and browser language. Persist only explicit theme/language choices in allowlisted Secure parent-domain cookies; preserve active work when another tab changes language. Adopt the reviewed shared runtime and test real cross-subdomain behavior and blocked storage.

For a new public VINASIG website handoff, launch, host change or DNS/discovery repair, apply SEARCH-003 and read templates/web/domain-discovery.md in the snapshot. Propose missing Cloudflare DNS and Search Console setup with exact fields/URLs. Retain working setup; separate submitted, fetched and indexed. Execute account changes only within existing authorization.

For UI changes read `policies/web.md` inside the snapshot. Apply LANG-004/LANG-005 to all visible copy and locales. WEB-001 requires original transparent header logos matched to the actual surface, without a padded or rounded logo card, linking to https://vinasig.io.vn/. Run inspectHeaderBrand and exercise the logo link on local and deployed pages. WEB-009 requires the shared header/footer contract for new projects too. Read templates/web/site-chrome.md, reuse the reviewed design-system source and run inspectSiteChrome on all layout routes/locales/themes. WEB-008 requires a full control inventory and styled initial/open/scrolled states, including popup scrollbars, checkbox/radio, search clear, range/progress parts and disclosure indicators. Use the reviewed control-surfaces CSS, preserve native form/keyboard/touch behavior and test forced colors. Run inspectControlSurfaces and inspectControlIndicators with nonzero expected counts. Ordinary dropdown indicators need a measured 16 px inner trailing inset, a 12 px value gap and their declared SVG size. Open before/after and deployed screenshots. Use `$vinasig-responsive` for layout/accessibility, `$vinasig-motion` for movement, `$vinasig-search` for SEO/AEO/GEO, `$vinasig-performance` for speed, and `$vinasig-agent-readiness` for browser-agent tasks. Space Grotesk, Lucide and Simple Icons follow their separate roles.

The local manifest pins the approved snapshot. A Markdown path is a reading instruction, not an automatic import. Stop and report unresolved conflicts with mandatory policy. Record approved exceptions with owner, reason and review date.
